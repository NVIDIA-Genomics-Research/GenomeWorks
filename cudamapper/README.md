# cudamapper

The `cudamapper` package provides minimizer-based GPU-accelerated approximate mapping.

## Tool - cudamapper

`cudamapper` is an end-to-end command line to for sequence to sequence mapping. `cudamapper` outputs
mappings in the PAF format and is currently optimised for all-vs-all long read (ONT, Pacific Biosciences) sequences.

To run all-vs all overlaps use the following command:

`cudamapper in.fasta in.fasta`

A query fasta can be mapped to a reference as follows:

`cudamapper query.fasta target.fasta`

To access more information about running cudamapper, run `cudamapper --help`.

## Library - libcudamapper.so

* `Indexer` module to generate an index of minimizers from a list of sequences.
* `Matcher` module to find locations of matching pairs of minimizers between sequences using minimizer indices.
* `Overlapper` module to generate overlaps from sequence of minimizer matches generated by matcher.

## Sample - sample_cudamapper

A prototypical binary highlighting the usage of `libcudamapper.so` APIs (indexer, matcher and overlapper) and
techniques to tie them into an application.
