# GenomeWorks

## Clone GenomeWorks
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:clara-genomics/GenomeWorks.git
```

## Build GenomeWorks
To build GenomeWorks -

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install
make -j install
```

## Enable Unit Tests
To enable unit tests, add `-Dgw_enable_tests=ON` to the `cmake` command in the build step.

This builds GTest based unit tests for all applicable modules, and installs them under
`${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/tests`. These tests are standalone binaries and can be executed
directly.
e.g.

```
cd $INSTALL_DIR
./tests/cudapoatests
```

## Enable Benchmarks
To enable benchmarks, add `-Dgw_enable_benchmarks=ON` to the `cmake` command in the build step.

This builds Google Benchmark based microbenchmarks for applicable modules. The built benchmarks
are installed under `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/benchmarks/<module>` and can be run directly.

e.g.
```
#INSTALL_DIR/benchmarks/cudapoa/multibatch
```

A description of each of the benchmarks is present in a README under the module's benchmark folder.

## Enable Doc Generation
To enable document generation for GenomeWorks, please install `Doxygen` on your system. Once
`Doxygen` has been installed, run the following to build documents.

```bash
make docs
```

## Enable Auto-Formatting
GenomeWorks makes use of `clang-format` to format it's source and header files. To make use of
auto-formatting, `clang-format` would have to be installed from the LLVM package (for latest builds,
best to refer to http://releases.llvm.org/download.html).

Once `clang-format` has been installed, make sure the binary is in your path.

To add a folder to the auto-formatting list, use the macro `gw_enable_auto_formatting(FOLDER)`. This
will add all cpp source/header files to the formatting list.

To auto-format, run the following in your build directory.

```bash
make format
```

To check if files are correct formatted, run the following in your build directory.

```bash
make check-format
```
