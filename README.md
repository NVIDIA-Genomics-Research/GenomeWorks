# Clara Genomics Analysis

## Overview

Clara Genomics Analysis is a GPU-accelerated library for biological sequence analysis. This section provides a brief overview of the different components of ClaraGenomicsAnalysis.
For more detailed API documentation please refer to the [documentation](#enable-doc-generation).

### cudapoa

The `cudapoa` package provides a GPU-accelerated implementation of the [Partial Order Alignment](https://simpsonlab.github.io/2015/05/01/understanding-poa/)
algorithm. It is heavily influenced by [SPOA](https://github.com/rvaser/spoa) and in many cases can be considered a GPU-accelerated replacement. Features include:

1. Generation of consensus sequences
2. Generation of multi-sequence alignments (MSAs)

### cudaaligner

The `cudaaligner` package provides GPU-accelerated global alignment.

## Clone Clara Genomics Analysis
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:clara-genomics/ClaraGenomicsAnalysis.git
```

## Build Clara Genomics Analysis
To build Clara Genomics Analysis -

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install
make -j install
```

## Enable Unit Tests
To enable unit tests, add `-Dcga_enable_tests=ON` to the `cmake` command in the build step.

This builds GTest based unit tests for all applicable modules, and installs them under
`${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/tests`. These tests are standalone binaries and can be executed
directly.
e.g.

```
cd $INSTALL_DIR
./tests/cudapoatests
```

## Enable Benchmarks
To enable benchmarks, add `-Dcga_enable_benchmarks=ON` to the `cmake` command in the build step.

This builds Google Benchmark based microbenchmarks for applicable modules. The built benchmarks
are installed under `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/benchmarks/<module>` and can be run directly.

e.g.
```
#INSTALL_DIR/benchmarks/cudapoa/multibatch
```

A description of each of the benchmarks is present in a README under the module's benchmark folder.

## Enable Doc Generation
To enable document generation for Clara Genomics Analysis, please install `Doxygen` on your system. Once
`Doxygen` has been installed, run the following to build documents.

```bash
make docs
```

## Code Formatting

### C++ / CUDA
Clara Genomics Analysis makes use of `clang-format` to format it's source and header files. To make use of
auto-formatting, `clang-format` would have to be installed from the LLVM package (for latest builds,
best to refer to http://releases.llvm.org/download.html).

Once `clang-format` has been installed, make sure the binary is in your path.

To add a folder to the auto-formatting list, use the macro `cga_enable_auto_formatting(FOLDER)`. This
will add all cpp source/header files to the formatting list.

To auto-format, run the following in your build directory.

```bash
make format
```

To check if files are correct formatted, run the following in your build directory.

```bash
make check-format
```

### Python
Clara Genomics Analysis follows the PEP-8 style guidelines for all its Python code. The automated
CI system for Clara Genomics Analysis run `flake8` to check the style.

To run style check manually, simply run the following from the top level folder.
```
flake8 pyclaragenomics/
```
