///
/// For example imagine 100000 bytes buffer has been preallocated and that sections between (10000, 19999), (30000, 39999)
/// and (60000, 79999) bytes have already been assigned:
///
/// 0 --- 10000 --- 20000 --- 30000 --- 40000 --- 50000 --- 60000 --- 70000 --- 80000 --- 90000 --- 100000

///
/// If an allocation request for 15000 bytes arrives allocator will starting looking for free block of at least 15000 bytes
/// looking from left to right and the first such block will be the one between (40000, 59999) bytes.
/// After the allocation the memory will look like this:
///
/// 0 --- 10000 --- 20000 --- 30000 --- 40000 ------ 55000 - 60000 --- 70000 --- 80000 --- 90000 --- 100000

///
/// Upon deallocation deallocated memory gets merged with neighboring free blocks, if any, so if section (10000, 19999) is
